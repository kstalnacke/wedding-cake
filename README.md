# Wedding Cake - React (Vite)

This project is a small React site (Vite) version of the existing static page.

Quick start:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- Open the server URL printed by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173).
- Build for production: `npm run build`.
- Preview production build: `npm run preview`.

Notes:
- The original `style.css` and `star.svg` remain in the project root and are used by the app.
- Update the `mailto:` address in `src/App.jsx` if needed.
